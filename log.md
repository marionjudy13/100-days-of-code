# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site. Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx. There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts**
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about. Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.

## Day 2: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Started responsive blog styles (mobile first), and cleaned up the layout.module sass. Mostly a styling day. Have a nice deployment pipeline setup with vercel. Also setup a new terminal emulator (Warp).

**Thoughts**
Basically same as yesterday, ready to be done with styles and get more into the stuff I'm not comfortable with. Not sure if it's worth it setting up the 'Kitchen Sink' of styles so I don't have to worry about it in the future, or if it's more effiencient to just add styles as needed. Would love other people's perspective on that!

## Day 3: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

I've been so anxious about Javascript, I decided to commit to completing the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on freeCodeCamp. So far today I am 55% into the Basic Javascript section. I also started back up with the "Front End Development Libraries Certification" and am working on the React section

**Thoughts**
It's pretty much review still, but I'm hoping the further along I get the more I'll get into the stuff that makes me nervous. I get so frustrated because I do have working experience with JS, React, Sanity, QROQ, and GraphQL, but I have these big gaps in my knowledge that make things really hard and frustrating sometime. Hopefully by spending the time really getting a foundation under me I will be able to accomplish more.

Also maybe having some of the certifications will help stregthen my portfolio since I don't have a CS degree.

## Day 4: August 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the first section of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, "Basic Javascript"

**Thoughts**
I mostly understood and worked through this section of the course with ease... Until I hit RECURSION. Holy moly. I read the articles associated with those lessons, and while it makes sense in the articles I think it will take a bit of practice for my brain to understand it in the wild.

## Day 5: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Built a little toggle button just for fun and completed one of the html challenges (form building) from freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design Course.

**Thoughts**
Today was a little rough as it was the first day of 10th grade for my daughter, and her first day out of quarantine from covid, AND I needed to deep clean the house before my 4 year old finally got to come back home, AND then there was driving all afternoon to pickups and activities. I was determined to get in my hour, but I definitely picked some lighter activities to get it done (while still stepping towards my goals). Definitely will do my hour FIRST tomorrow instead of waiting until the end of the day.

## Day 6: August 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the ES6 part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

**Thoughts**
Was pretty familiar with most of this since I've worked on several react projects in the last couple years. I'm so glad to be filling in the gaps in my knowledge and look forward to being the one writing the majority of the code as opposed to the person working within and just doing little odds and ends tasks. Goals!

## Day 7: August 12, Friday (night)

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on blog project... Content and mobile styles

**Thoughts**
I definitely don't need to try and include EVERYTHING in a kitchen sink styles page. Worked on updating content to represent more of what I'll actually be using, and added some mobile styles. Better late than never today :)

## Day 8: August 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'. Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts**
I've worked with React so much already, so this is all very familiar. However, since I'm self taught and was always just navigating a senior dev's code, this course is REALLY improving my confidence in understanding how everything is actually working and the terminology. In the past, I've had people ask me about something and I will think I don't know, but when I actually see the code I actually DO know - I just didn't understand the terminology. So I'm pretty excited to be able to communicate better :) I also really like the breakdown of props in this course!

## Day 9: August 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday! Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'. Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts**
LOSING MY MIND with stateful components... I finally see why it's so cool!! I did the little simple counter exersize and it feels like some things have connected in my brain!

## Day 10: August 15, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday, AGAIN! Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'. Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts**
Still super pumped about React States... Today I learned about passing states to child components through props, and I'm loving having a better understanding of what's actually happening when I work with React!

## Day 11: August 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on lifecycle methods and ternary expressions for conditional renderering freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.

**Thoughts**
Still loving this, and loving learning about lifecycle methods and getting a little hint about calling APIs with React. The conditional rendering and ternary operators was mostly review, but I did fill in some knowledge gaps!

## Day 12: August 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on conditional rendering using props and ternery operators in React. Also a wee bit of SASS.

**Thoughts**
Squeezing this in last today and i'm TIRED. Having a hard to wrapping my sleepy brain around things tonight, so I copied things over to codepen and used comments to walk through everything that is happening in the code. It was very helpful, and I'd be interested in what the call stack for this code looks like! Maybe tomorrow I'll write out what I think and ask for feedback.

## Day 13: August 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through the SASS section of the Front End Dev Certification. Today was a busy day with some challenging life-stuff - so I kept it light. I love SASS! I also added a little toggle onto my SASS codePen, just for fun!

**Thoughts**
I'm really excited to actually complete this course and have a better understanding of React. I've done bits of sooo many courses on my dev journey, and this will be the first course I've completed start to finish.

## Day 14: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the React portion of the Front End Dev Cert! I have the Redux, Redux & React, and then certification projects to finish!

**Thoughts**
I go back and forth pretty violently feeling like I'm understanding things and feeling like I know nothing. I'm looking forward to the cert projects!

## Day 15: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Started the Redux section of the Front End Dev Cert, and spent some time on my portfolio site!

**Thoughts**
It feels like I missed something on the course about redux. I feel tooottally unprepared for the challenges. I'm going to look for another resource to help me out!

It's next to impossible to work with both kids home and no help, so I'm grateful to get my time in. Grateful for my teenager!

## Day 16: August 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Got my calculator certification project started, and completed the tribute page on the "(New) Responsive Web Design" certification course.

**Thoughts**
I would have covered more tonight but I accidentally deleted the tribute page riiiiight before it was completed!  I decided to move over to VS Code for the cert projects to avoid that problem in the future.

Kept it pretty light tonight.

## Day 17: August 22, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site!

**Thoughts**
I definitely couldn't focus on work today HAH ugh. Tomorrow will be a new day!

**Link(s) to work**
No link today, not until the site is a little closer!

---

## Day 18: August 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site, and worked on a vanilla js calculator!

**Thoughts**
I took my first day off the challenge yesterday, and feel recharged! I'm almost done with the freeCodeCamp frontend libraries cert course. The first project is to build a little calulator. I've been thinking about it alot, and started building in vanilla js first today because I want to see how things are different between vanilla and using React.

I think the more confident I am with normalllll ol javascript, the better I can keep up with the fast paced evolution of the Internet. I know the courses I'm taking now are already somewhat behind.

---

## Day 19: August 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Same as yesterday... worked on my portfolio site, and worked on a vanilla js calculator!

**Thoughts**
Spent probably too much time messing with the calculator's styling. Something is wonky and I am just not seeing it yet.

**Link(s) to work**
The code was getting a little hard to follow, so I moved it locally for now!

---

## Day 20: August 26, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site! And messed around a bit with deploying a webflow site on Netlify.

**Thoughts**
My portfolio is SO CLOSE to done. I honestly want to work on a million other things, but I know I need to get it done!! I think I can finish it tomorrow.

I'm building it in Webflow now, since time is of the essence. I am planning on replicating it in Next and with Sanity. Literally can't wait, I'm so excited! It will be nice to have all the content and everything ready so I can just focus on the code and functionality!

**Link(s) to work**
No links today! I'll post a link when it's done.

---

## Day 21: August 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Allllmooost donnne with my porrrtfolioooo

**Thoughts**
Well, I thought I would be able to get it done, but I didn't have enough time. Definitely should be able to finish it Monday! Done to the last bit of content & details.

**Link(s) to work**
No links today! I'll post a link when it's done.

---

## Day 22: August 28, Sunday

Little bit of portfolio, little bit of working with APIs, lots of trying not to fall asleep because today was me and Maya's day to celebrate with Tol for his 5th bday and I'm soooo tirrrredddd

**Thoughts**
I need to figure out a 'home' link element for my portfolio site. I was mostly too tired tonight to do anything substantial. Tomorrow's a fresh start.

**Link(s) to work**
No links today!

---

## Day 23: August 29, Monday

Fine tuned portfolio, finished the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp and got my certificate!

**Thoughts**
Definitely did the bare minimum to complete the course since it was review. Maybe I should go back and make things look prettier?

---

## Day 24: August 30, Tuesday

Fine tuned portfolio, worked on my calculator!

**Thoughts**
I'm building the calculator in React, and then in vanilla JS. Maybe backwards, but whatever!

---

## Day 25: August 31, Wednesday

Worked on my calculator!

**Thoughts**
There's clearly a million ways to do this.

---

## Day 26: September 2, Friday

Worked on my calculator again!

**Thoughts**
I'm following along a tutorial now, and it's so complicated. I think tomorrow I'll work on my watermelon project just for a morale boost.

\*\*Links

---

## Day 27: September 3, Saturday

I offically had a working calculator!

**Thoughts**
I decided I should probably finish up my calculator instead of adding yet another half finished project to the list. It's funcational, but still needs finishing touches! I followed along with this guy (after trying on my own for awhile) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX-6Y2oGjI

## Day 28: September 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Took a break from coding exercises to work on a personal project! Feeling super comfortable with React & JS basics.

**Thoughts**
I love this website haha... I need to make the table responsive, and I also need to make individual pages for each watermelon entry. Also sorting so the order isn't all wonky.

---

## Day 29: September 5, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Added some finishing touches to my portfolio and fine-tuning everything!

**Thoughts**
I'm overall pretty happy with how my portfolio is turning out! I have such mixed feeling about Webflow. Sometimes it seems easier and sometimes not. I do get frustrated with needing to repeat actions in Webflow, but maybe I'm missing something. I definitely don't like the animation, and spent some time today building my own mobile menu.

## Day 30: September 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Finished up my portfolio site! Lots of custom css and updating metadata today!

**Thoughts**
I will probably continue to fiddle with this every now and then. I'd like to add a link to my resume, make the arrows on the project pages more consistent, and update some of the copy here and there. Overall, it's me and my work!

## Day 31: September 9, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned that responsive tables are HARD.

**Thoughts**
I am so frustrated! This has been probably my least productive day of the challenge. It is SO hard to make tables responsive. It was easy enough to make everything display: block, but then the thead is missing from each column of course. Ugh! Going to go to the discord community for this one. I even tried using an NPM package that totally almost worked, but then the breakpoint was wrong and I'm not sure how to fix that. Feeling a little defeated today!

## Day 32 & 33: September 10, Saturday & September 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned about sorting!!

**Thoughts**
It took me a minute (2 dayssss) to understand sorting my array of objects, but I got it now! I feel like I have lots of little pieces of knowledge, and sometimes I have a hard time putting them together right. Once I get stuff put together though it feels AWESOME! I think I need to focus less on tutorials and more on just building projects so I'm actually seeing how to use things IRL. I started with sorting the content on the component level, and after I got that I figured out how to sort my data query instead! I also learned how to order the content in Sanity which is SO COOL. Feeling good today :)

## Day 34: September 12, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned how to make a typewriter effect with both javascript and css (preferred the js solution)

**Thoughts**
This was both fun AND frustrating! I would still like to add a little cursor animation, and a pause after the 'hi'. Tomorrow!

## Day 35: September 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Added my resume to the portfolio site. Also updated links on the Dirty Carrots site, and started building a topnav for the blog layout.

**Thoughts**
I wish there was was more time everyday. There's never enough time to do all the things I'd like to do! I am SUPER excited to be wrapping up my portfolio page! I am itching to get back to building out Dirty Carrots and the Plantones site. I have a new project idea in mind that I am REALLY excited about, but I am not going to start it until I finish what I have going! Or at least get to an MVP. Need more time!!

**Thoughts**
I am ready to start applying for jobs!! Ready enough anyways... There's always something to work on!

## Day 37: September 16, Friday

**Today's Progress & THoughts:**
Worked on the dev blog a bit. Added a link and some styles to the nav component, and worked on blog posts styles. I wasn't happy with the blog post styles though, so I will probably scrap and start over :)

## Day 38: September 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on dirty carrots mobile styles.

Thoughts:
Looking better! I've decided I do NOT like the kitchen sink approach for rich text. I'm going to style the text in the blog posts I have, and will add on as needed!

## Day 39: September 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on dirty carrots styles and began adding work in progress ribbon to project sites.

Thoughts:
Something weird is going on with my ribbon styles! It's not using the right font for some reason.

**Links**
[Dirty Carrots](https://www.dirtycarrots.dev/)

---

## Day 40: September 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Finished the Work in Progress ribbon on Dirty Carrots!

Thoughts:
There's still something weird going on... I think probably I did something weird when setting up my page layouts maybe? I was having a really hard time getting it to recognize the styles when added to the component on the post layout, and finally got it by using this form: '&[class='rightSide']' (Thanks Scott!) I'll add it to my other projects and then will be back to building and learning!

## Day 41: September 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on Watermelon site's ribbon, started a lesson on APIs

Thoughts:
Something is weird about the banner on the Watermelon site. Everything works great locally, but the styles are all wonky when I push live. I will revisit it tomorrow when my brain is fresh! I also started a twitch course about APIs by Leon Noel. I'm really loving his teaching style so far!

## Day 42: September 21, 2022 & Day 43: Sept 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**
I forgot to log yesterday, so I'm double logging! I spend a little time yesterday fixing the weird CSS issue on the Watermelon site. I also joined a new bootcamp course/community, I also worked on the React Intro tutorial.

Thoughts:
The CSS issue was something to do with the banner's parent styles. I also started a Twitch bootcamp course yesterday called Learning with Leon. He has a TON of CS knowledge and so far I really like the way he teaches! I did more of that course and started the react intro tutorial as well. I am enjoying filling in the gaps in my knowledge! It is really improving my confidence and skill.

---

## Day 44: September 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Made some great progress learning about APIs today!! Also started CodeWars.

Thoughts:
I looooove the Learning with Leon Twitch channel!! I followed his API class and it was so great. I came in with some knowledge, but was able to fill in some blanks and feel way more confident! I'm going to start his bootcamp from the very beginning, and spend some time with that and some time building my own projects. I REALLY love getting some of that core knowledge in a 'classroom' type setting, and I get so pumped when I know the answers already!! I started Codewars as well and DANG that's a challenge!

## Day 45: September 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Started to get Plantones (or Fifty Shades), not sure what to call it, going today! Got setup with Next.js and Tailwind (Tailwind for the first time!)

Thoughts:
So since I have ears I've been hearing about Tailwind for awhile now. I have yet to build anything with it though! Until now! I spent a majority of today's time just reading through the docs and getting aclimated, and when I finally went to the code and changed the page's bg color I audibly 'oh my god'ed. This is awesome!! I love the consistency that it forces you into. We'll see how I feel after I get deeper into the design hah

I also spent some time today watching a few video's recommended by Learning with Leon about 'Learning Effectively'. What I got from it is basically I need to be building like crazy, and maybe using ANKI flashcards to actually remember technicalities.

## Day 46: September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Got my Sanity studio all setup.

**Thoughts:**
Got my Sanity studio all setup and was ready to get going when I realized I had accidentally setup the project in TypeScript. I'm going to scrap it and start over. I really want to focus on Tailwind and Sanity on this project. TypeScript will be for another day!

**Links**
No links yet, still local

---

## Day 47: September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Started my project site over in Next.js, Tailwind, and Sanity! I had accidentally setup in typescript the first time, and I wanted to focus on learning Tailwind on this project. Typescript will be a future project! Also did some writing and youtube course time.

**Thoughts:**
Made some great progress today! I ended up missing yesterday due to an awful headache, but I got a great night's sleep and I think my brain was like YESSSS THANK YOU. I reset the Plantones site, it's officially running using Next.js, Tailwind, and Sanity! Sanity CMS is all setup and pulling in data, too! I was messing around with Tailwind again and I'm really excited about it. I LOVE css and this feels a bit like css 2.0, so effiecient! I also wrote out my process of getting the site setup and running. Tomorrow I'm going to go through the steps and makes sure I didn't miss anything. It will probably be a work in progress. I'm using my dirtycarrots.dev to document it. I also am still watching the Learning with Leon youtube series and am head over heals for the course so far! He does a REALLY great job of setting the scene for software engineering. I'd like to run a similar course someday for Tertia! I am really enjoying taking some time to just learn and fill some gaps in my knowledge.

## Day 48: September 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Finished up and double-checked my setup notes! Looks like everything is working great. Started up a new repo so I can rebuild my portfolio in React.

**Thoughts:**
I'm worried that I don't have enough current React projects in my portfolio. I'm going to start spending way more time just building! I think it'd be nice to build my own little boilerplate.

## Day 49: September 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Fixed a build error on Dirty Carrots dev blog, and started building Plantones v2

**Thoughts:**
I was SO excited when I fixed the Dirty Carrots build error. I was trying to import my fonts through the Head component on my index AND layout. I didn't realize that since I didn't have a `_document.js` file setup, the font's weren't being imported globally. I had imported them separately on my post layout, but then I got the build error! Figuring out the document page was awesome! I had always wondered the best way to apply styles to the body, and that's ALSO using the `document.js` page, so COOL! I also working on my Plantonesv2 project. Got my font imported (correctly, now that I know what I'm doing), and started building using Tailwind for styles! I really like it so far! I REALLY like setting up my color/font settings in the `tailwind.config.js` file. So far, I love it. I also setup the deploy with Netlify instead of Vercel this time, just to do something a little different.

## Day 50: October 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on some open source stuff on Github!

**Thoughts:**
Well, that was not nearly as fruitful as I thought it would be! It's hard to find a project and understand what the issues are well enough to think I can resolve them. Those that I DID find tended to already have several people already submitting PRs. I did a could PRs on some beginner projects, and will try again tomorrow!

No links until PRs are approved.

## Day 51: October 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on Plantonesv2

**Thoughts:**
Still really enjoying Tailwind! I worked on the Sanity schema a bit today. I need to find a solution for picking a color from an image uploaded in Sanity. I also need to figure out references in the schema so that eventually plants can be sorted by light, soil requirements, etc. All mobile styles still!

## Day 52: October 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on Plantonesv2 & My portfolio site a little

**Thoughts:**
Learned about Tailwind aspect ratios today! Also started adding styles for bigger breakpoints. Added on to my schema file as well. Also updated the link to Plantones in my portfolio site, and added a little png that introduces Mittens.

## Day 53 & Day 54: October 5 & 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Logging for yesterday and today! Worked through the entire React docs tutorial & worked on my plantones site!

**Thoughts:**
Didn't log yesterday - too crazy of a day and it was one of the balls to be dropped. I tried to work on my Plantones project yesterday, but I ran into a few road blocks! I made notes on where I was stuck, and met up with my buddy Scott today to work through everything! I was trying to figure out how to import my background images from Sanity using Tailwind, and you can't (haha ugh). You can totally just add them dynamically using inline-styles though, so that was awesome! I also wanted each plant to have it's own page, so he helped me get that setup, too. I learned so much today! It's getting WAY easier to see what's happening in all of my projects, I love it. I also worked through the react docs tutorial today (the tic-tac-toe game). I want to really wrap my head around states, so I'm just going to keep building!

## Day 55: October 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Spent a little time getting some vscode extensions setup, started setting up the individual plant page components.

**Thoughts:**
It's good to be back after fall break! I got my prettier setup to format my JSX on save, which is insanely helpful! Also messed around with destructuring my data from my parent component to the children components!

## Day 56: October 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Added a few things to my Sanity schema, added some styles, and added some content!

**Thoughts:**
Not a lot of deep thoughts today, just enjoying this project!

## Day 57: October 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Spent the whole day trying to figure out a build error, to no avail! :(

**Thoughts:**
SOoooOOooOOoo frustrated... I'm not sure what this error is. It looked like it was an error with my import paths, but all that is fixed and now the only error seems to be a linter error. I just keep hitting my head on the wall with this one! If I can't figure it out I might just nuke it and start over ::sobbing::

## Day 58: October 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Started Plantones over from scratch.

**Thoughts:**
Well, it only took a couple hours, and I took the opportunity to update some of my setup notes on Dirty Carrots as well. It's building successfully again! I must have done soooomething when I added my linter, so I'll be avoiding that for now. :) Back to building!

## Day 59: October 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Did a bunch of JS exercise for funsies (or to break my brain??)

**Thoughts:**
I really enjoy doing the codewars challenges... I am pretty good at building websites, generally, but rarely get to exercise my javascript knowledge. Codewars feels like the gym, for coding! (Nerd alert, but whatever, it's fun!)

**Links:**
No links today.

## Day 60: October 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my Next.js/Sanity.io plant site some more!

**Thoughts:**
The deeper I get into this build, the more confusing the flow of data is. I'd like to spend some more time exploring that so I feel more confident!

## Day 61: October 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Got some block data flowing from Sanity into Next.js! Also, broke my brain a little, but finally figured out some flex styles to act the way I wanted!

**Thoughts:**
I thought pulling in the block content was going to be way more difficult than it was! I do feel like my code is getting a little messy... I'm also scared to run a linter again since I'm pretty sure that's what broke my netlify build on v2. Maybe once I've finished pulling in the basic content I will ask the sanity community to review and suggest ways to clean up the code?

## Day 62: October 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on Plantones

**Thoughts:**
Got some feedback from Scott that was helpful! I didn't think to save my queries out in separate files! Very cool. He also pointed out some 'best practices' I could apply. So helpful!!!

## Day 64: November 2 & 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Built a little 'quote of the day' project in Vanilla JS then in Next.js

**Thoughts:**
Well, I've been coding everyday for sure, but haven't been logging! I've been working on my plantones site a little, revisited eslint & prettier, and studied apis using VanillaJS and Next.js! The project pulls in data from two sources to create the background image (Nasa's Picture of the Day) and Zenquotes. I was so intimated by APIs earlier in my career, and I shouldn't have been!

## Day 65: November 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on Plantones! Also did some Codewars.

**Thoughts:**
I'm going to spend the next few days finishing this up so I can start on the next project! I think I'll rebuild my Webflow portfolio next! I also did some Codewars challenges today, and updated my Github credentials via github cli and auth token! Feeling simultaneously capable and new at this hah

## Day 66: November 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Codewars for my full hour!

**Thoughts:**
I did my first code challenge the other day, and it was SO HARD. Like, nothing I have ever seen in the past 5 years I've been working in the web dev world. I was feeling pretty deflated, and I figure the best way to combat that is by working on my JS skills! My goal will be at least 3 challenges a day.

## Day 67: November 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Codewars for 15 minutes then Plantones for like 3 hours!

**Thoughts:**
Getting so close to being finished with Plantones!! I'm feeling so much more confident, and excited to start from scratch again with the next project! Also I forgot to log this yesterday so I'm logging a day late!

## Day 68: November 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Plantones and Codewars again!!

**Thoughts:**
Ran into some challenges with TailWind... Nothing crazy - but I have a hex code that is pulled in from my Sanity data, and it's a little confusing finding the best way to apply a hover state with the data! I think I can either use state and put my styles in an object and implement them with inline styles, or just add a dummy element and be done.
