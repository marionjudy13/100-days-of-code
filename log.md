# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site.  Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx.  There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts** 
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about.  Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.

## Day 2: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Started responsive blog styles (mobile first), and cleaned up the layout.module sass.  Mostly a styling day. Have a nice deployment pipeline setup with vercel.  Also setup a new terminal emulator (Warp).  

**Thoughts** 
Basically same as yesterday, ready to be done with styles and get more into the stuff I'm not comfortable with.  Not sure if it's worth it setting up the 'Kitchen Sink' of styles so I don't have to worry about it in the future, or if it's more effiencient to just add styles as needed.  Would love other people's perspective on that!

## Day 3: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

I've been so anxious about Javascript, I decided to commit to completing the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on freeCodeCamp.  So far today I am 55% into the Basic Javascript section.  I also started back up with the "Front End Development Libraries Certification" and am working on the React section

**Thoughts** 
It's pretty much review still, but I'm hoping the further along I get the more I'll get into the stuff that makes me nervous.  I get so frustrated because I do have working experience with JS, React, Sanity, QROQ, and GraphQL, but I have these big gaps in my knowledge that make things really hard and frustrating sometime.  Hopefully by spending the time really getting a foundation under me I will be able to accomplish more. 

Also maybe having some of the certifications will help stregthen my portfolio since I don't have a CS degree.

## Day 4: August 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the first section of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, "Basic Javascript"

**Thoughts** 
I mostly understood and worked through this section of the course with ease... Until I hit RECURSION.  Holy moly.  I read the articles associated with those lessons, and while it makes sense in the articles I think it will take a bit of practice for my brain to understand it in the wild.
