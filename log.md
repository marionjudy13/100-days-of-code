# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site.  Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx.  There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts** 
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about.  Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.
