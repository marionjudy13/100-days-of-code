# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site.  Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx.  There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts** 
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about.  Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.

## Day 2: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Started responsive blog styles (mobile first), and cleaned up the layout.module sass.  Mostly a styling day. Have a nice deployment pipeline setup with vercel.  Also setup a new terminal emulator (Warp).  

**Thoughts** 
Basically same as yesterday, ready to be done with styles and get more into the stuff I'm not comfortable with.  Not sure if it's worth it setting up the 'Kitchen Sink' of styles so I don't have to worry about it in the future, or if it's more effiencient to just add styles as needed.  Would love other people's perspective on that!
