# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site.  Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx.  There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts** 
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about.  Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.

## Day 2: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Started responsive blog styles (mobile first), and cleaned up the layout.module sass.  Mostly a styling day. Have a nice deployment pipeline setup with vercel.  Also setup a new terminal emulator (Warp).  

**Thoughts** 
Basically same as yesterday, ready to be done with styles and get more into the stuff I'm not comfortable with.  Not sure if it's worth it setting up the 'Kitchen Sink' of styles so I don't have to worry about it in the future, or if it's more effiencient to just add styles as needed.  Would love other people's perspective on that!

## Day 3: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

I've been so anxious about Javascript, I decided to commit to completing the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on freeCodeCamp.  So far today I am 55% into the Basic Javascript section.  I also started back up with the "Front End Development Libraries Certification" and am working on the React section

**Thoughts** 
It's pretty much review still, but I'm hoping the further along I get the more I'll get into the stuff that makes me nervous.  I get so frustrated because I do have working experience with JS, React, Sanity, QROQ, and GraphQL, but I have these big gaps in my knowledge that make things really hard and frustrating sometime.  Hopefully by spending the time really getting a foundation under me I will be able to accomplish more. 

Also maybe having some of the certifications will help stregthen my portfolio since I don't have a CS degree.

## Day 4: August 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the first section of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, "Basic Javascript"

**Thoughts** 
I mostly understood and worked through this section of the course with ease... Until I hit RECURSION.  Holy moly.  I read the articles associated with those lessons, and while it makes sense in the articles I think it will take a bit of practice for my brain to understand it in the wild.

## Day 5: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Built a little toggle button just for fun and completed one of the html challenges (form building) from freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design Course.  

**Thoughts** 
Today was a little rough as it was the first day of 10th grade for my daughter, and her first day out of quarantine from covid, AND I needed to deep clean the house before my 4 year old finally got to come back home, AND then there was driving all afternoon to pickups and activities.  I was determined to get in my hour, but I definitely picked some lighter activities to get it done (while still stepping towards my goals). Definitely will do my hour FIRST tomorrow instead of waiting until the end of the day.

## Day 6: August 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the ES6 part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

**Thoughts** 
Was pretty familiar with most of this since I've worked on several react projects in the last couple years.  I'm so glad to be filling in the gaps in my knowledge and look forward to being the one writing the majority of the code as opposed to the person working within and just doing little odds and ends tasks.  Goals!

## Day 7: August 12, Friday (night)

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on blog project... Content and mobile styles

**Thoughts** 
I definitely don't need to try and include EVERYTHING in a kitchen sink styles page.  Worked on updating content to represent more of what I'll actually be using, and added some mobile styles.  Better late than never today :)

## Day 8: August 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
I've worked with React so much already, so this is all very familiar.  However, since I'm self taught and was always just navigating a senior dev's code, this course is REALLY improving my confidence in understanding how everything is actually working and the terminology.  In the past, I've had people ask me about something and I will think I don't know, but when I actually see the code I actually DO know - I just didn't understand the terminology.  So I'm pretty excited to be able to communicate better :)  I also really like the breakdown of props in this course!

## Day 9: August 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday!  Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
LOSING MY MIND with stateful components... I finally see why it's so cool!!  I did the little simple counter exersize and it feels like some things have connected in my brain!

## Day 10: August 15, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday, AGAIN!  Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
Still super pumped about React States... Today I learned about passing states to child components through props, and I'm loving having a better understanding of what's actually happening when I work with React!

## Day 11: August 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on lifecycle methods and ternary expressions for conditional renderering freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  

**Thoughts** 
Still loving this, and loving learning about lifecycle methods and getting a little hint about calling APIs with React.  The conditional rendering and ternary operators was mostly review, but I did fill in some knowledge gaps!

## Day 12: August 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on conditional rendering using props and ternery operators in React.  Also a wee bit of SASS.

**Thoughts** 
Squeezing this in last today and i'm TIRED.  Having a hard to wrapping my sleepy brain around things tonight, so I copied things over to codepen and used comments to walk through everything that is happening in the code.  It was very helpful, and I'd be interested in what the call stack for this code looks like!  Maybe tomorrow I'll write out what I think and ask for feedback.
