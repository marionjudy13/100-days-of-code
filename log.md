# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

Added a "Kitchen Sink" page of html elements to my next.js blog site.  Took me a minute to get the html (copied from [this repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink)) all updated to jsx.  There's still a couple little chunks of html I commented out to fix later (not a priority, but I will add it to the blogs issues so I don't forget).

Also, removed some of the placeholder text for some of the other blog post topics.

**Thoughts** 
I'm excited to finish setting up the blog styles and start using the blog to document what I'm working on or learning about.  Eventually I want to add in sorting and a search function as well.

## Day 2: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

Started responsive blog styles (mobile first), and cleaned up the layout.module sass.  Mostly a styling day. Have a nice deployment pipeline setup with vercel.  Also setup a new terminal emulator (Warp).  

**Thoughts** 
Basically same as yesterday, ready to be done with styles and get more into the stuff I'm not comfortable with.  Not sure if it's worth it setting up the 'Kitchen Sink' of styles so I don't have to worry about it in the future, or if it's more effiencient to just add styles as needed.  Would love other people's perspective on that!

## Day 3: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

I've been so anxious about Javascript, I decided to commit to completing the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on freeCodeCamp.  So far today I am 55% into the Basic Javascript section.  I also started back up with the "Front End Development Libraries Certification" and am working on the React section

**Thoughts** 
It's pretty much review still, but I'm hoping the further along I get the more I'll get into the stuff that makes me nervous.  I get so frustrated because I do have working experience with JS, React, Sanity, QROQ, and GraphQL, but I have these big gaps in my knowledge that make things really hard and frustrating sometime.  Hopefully by spending the time really getting a foundation under me I will be able to accomplish more. 

Also maybe having some of the certifications will help stregthen my portfolio since I don't have a CS degree.

## Day 4: August 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the first section of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, "Basic Javascript"

**Thoughts** 
I mostly understood and worked through this section of the course with ease... Until I hit RECURSION.  Holy moly.  I read the articles associated with those lessons, and while it makes sense in the articles I think it will take a bit of practice for my brain to understand it in the wild.

## Day 5: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Built a little toggle button just for fun and completed one of the html challenges (form building) from freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design Course.  

**Thoughts** 
Today was a little rough as it was the first day of 10th grade for my daughter, and her first day out of quarantine from covid, AND I needed to deep clean the house before my 4 year old finally got to come back home, AND then there was driving all afternoon to pickups and activities.  I was determined to get in my hour, but I definitely picked some lighter activities to get it done (while still stepping towards my goals). Definitely will do my hour FIRST tomorrow instead of waiting until the end of the day.

## Day 6: August 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the ES6 part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

**Thoughts** 
Was pretty familiar with most of this since I've worked on several react projects in the last couple years.  I'm so glad to be filling in the gaps in my knowledge and look forward to being the one writing the majority of the code as opposed to the person working within and just doing little odds and ends tasks.  Goals!

## Day 7: August 12, Friday (night)

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on blog project... Content and mobile styles

**Thoughts** 
I definitely don't need to try and include EVERYTHING in a kitchen sink styles page.  Worked on updating content to represent more of what I'll actually be using, and added some mobile styles.  Better late than never today :)

## Day 8: August 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
I've worked with React so much already, so this is all very familiar.  However, since I'm self taught and was always just navigating a senior dev's code, this course is REALLY improving my confidence in understanding how everything is actually working and the terminology.  In the past, I've had people ask me about something and I will think I don't know, but when I actually see the code I actually DO know - I just didn't understand the terminology.  So I'm pretty excited to be able to communicate better :)  I also really like the breakdown of props in this course!

## Day 9: August 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday!  Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
LOSING MY MIND with stateful components... I finally see why it's so cool!!  I did the little simple counter exersize and it feels like some things have connected in my brain!

## Day 10: August 15, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Pretty much same as yesterday, AGAIN!  Worked on freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  Built several new pens in CodePen for my own reference.

**Thoughts** 
Still super pumped about React States... Today I learned about passing states to child components through props, and I'm loving having a better understanding of what's actually happening when I work with React!

## Day 11: August 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on lifecycle methods and ternary expressions for conditional renderering freeCodeCamp's 'Front End Development Libraries - React'.  

**Thoughts** 
Still loving this, and loving learning about lifecycle methods and getting a little hint about calling APIs with React.  The conditional rendering and ternary operators was mostly review, but I did fill in some knowledge gaps!

## Day 12: August 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on conditional rendering using props and ternery operators in React.  Also a wee bit of SASS.

**Thoughts** 
Squeezing this in last today and i'm TIRED.  Having a hard to wrapping my sleepy brain around things tonight, so I copied things over to codepen and used comments to walk through everything that is happening in the code.  It was very helpful, and I'd be interested in what the call stack for this code looks like!  Maybe tomorrow I'll write out what I think and ask for feedback.

## Day 13: August 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through the SASS section of the Front End Dev Certification.  Today was a busy day with some challenging life-stuff - so I kept it light. I love SASS! I also added a little toggle onto my SASS codePen, just for fun!

**Thoughts** 
I'm really excited to actually complete this course and have a better understanding of React. I've done bits of sooo many courses on my dev journey, and this will be the first course I've completed start to finish.

## Day 14: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Completed the React portion of the Front End Dev Cert!  I have the Redux, Redux & React, and then certification projects to finish! 

**Thoughts** 
I go back and forth pretty violently feeling like I'm understanding things and feeling like I know nothing. I'm looking forward to the cert projects!

## Day 15: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Started the Redux section of the Front End Dev Cert, and spent some time on my portfolio site! 

**Thoughts** 
It feels like I missed something on the course about redux. I feel tooottally unprepared for the challenges.  I'm going to look for another resource to help me out!

It's next to impossible to work with both kids home and no help, so I'm grateful to get my time in.  Grateful for my teenager!

## Day 16: August 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Got my calculator certification project started, and completed the tribute page on the "(New) Responsive Web Design" certification course.  

**Thoughts** 
I would have covered more tonight but I accidentally deleted the tribute page riiiiight before it was completed!  I decided to move over to VS Code for the cert projects to avoid that problem in the future.  

Kept it pretty light tonight.

## Day 17: August 22, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site! 

**Thoughts** 
I definitely couldn't focus on work today HAH ugh.  Tomorrow will be a new day!

**Link(s) to work**
No link today, not until the site is a little closer!

## Day 18: August 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site, and worked on a vanilla js calculator! 

**Thoughts** 
I took my first day off the challenge yesterday, and feel recharged! I'm almost done with the freeCodeCamp frontend libraries cert course.  The first project is to build a little calulator.  I've been thinking about it alot, and started building in vanilla js first today because I want to see how things are different between vanilla and using React.

I think the more confident I am with normalllll ol javascript, the better I can keep up with the fast paced evolution of the Internet.  I know the courses I'm taking now are already somewhat behind.

## Day 19: August 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Same as yesterday... worked on my portfolio site, and worked on a vanilla js calculator! 

**Thoughts** 
Spent probably too much time messing with the calculator's styling.  Something is wonky and I am just not seeing it yet.


**Link(s) to work**
The code was getting a little hard to follow, so I moved it locally for now!

---

## Day 20: August 26, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my portfolio site! And messed around a bit with deploying a webflow site on Netlify.  

**Thoughts** 
My portfolio is SO CLOSE to done.  I honestly want to work on a million other things, but I know I need to get it done!!  I think I can finish it tomorrow.

I'm building it in Webflow now, since time is of the essence.  I am planning on replicating it in Next and with Sanity.  Literally can't wait, I'm so excited!  It will be nice to have all the content and everything ready so I can just focus on the code and functionality!

**Link(s) to work**
No links today!  I'll post a link when it's done.

## Day 21: August 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
Allllmooost donnne with my porrrtfolioooo 

**Thoughts** 
Well, I thought I would be able to get it done, but I didn't have enough time.  Definitely should be able to finish it Monday! Done to the last bit of content & details.

**Link(s) to work**
No links today!  I'll post a link when it's done.

---

## Day 22: August 28, Sunday

Little bit of portfolio, little bit of working with APIs, lots of trying not to fall asleep because today was me and Maya's day to celebrate with Tol for his 5th bday and I'm soooo tirrrredddd

**Thoughts** 
I need to figure out a 'home' link element for my portfolio site. I was mostly too tired tonight to do anything substantial.  Tomorrow's a fresh start.

**Link(s) to work**
No links today! 


---

## Day 23: August 29, Monday

Fine tuned portfolio, finished the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp and got my certificate!

**Thoughts** 
Definitely did the bare minimum to complete the course since it was review.  Maybe I should go back and make things look prettier?

## Day 24: August 30, Tuesday

Fine tuned portfolio, worked on my calculator!  

**Thoughts** 
I'm building the calculator in React, and then in vanilla JS.  Maybe backwards, but whatever!


---

## Day 25: August 31, Wednesday

Worked on my calculator!  

**Thoughts** 
There's clearly a million ways to do this.  


---

## Day 26: September 2, Friday

Worked on my calculator again! 

**Thoughts** 
I'm following along a tutorial now, and it's so complicated.  I think tomorrow I'll work on my watermelon project just for a morale boost.

## Day 27: September 3, Saturday

I offically had a working calculator!  

**Thoughts** 
I decided I should probably finish up my calculator instead of adding yet another half finished project to the list.  It's funcational, but still needs finishing touches!  I followed along with this guy (after trying on my own for awhile)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiX-6Y2oGjI

## Day 28: September 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Took a break from coding exercises to work on a personal project!   Feeling super comfortable with React & JS basics.   

**Thoughts** 
I love this website haha... I need to make the table responsive, and I also need to make individual pages for each watermelon entry.  Also sorting so the order isn't all wonky.

 ---

## Day 29: September 5, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Added some finishing touches to my portfolio and fine-tuning everything!

**Thoughts** 
I'm overall pretty happy with how my portfolio is turning out!  I have such mixed feeling about Webflow.  Sometimes it seems easier and sometimes not.  I do get frustrated with needing to repeat actions in Webflow, but maybe I'm missing something.  I definitely don't like the animation, and spent some time today building my own mobile menu.

## Day 30: September 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
Finished up my portfolio site!  Lots of custom css and updating metadata today! 

**Thoughts** 
I will probably continue to fiddle with this every now and then.  I'd like to add a link to my resume, make the arrows on the project pages more consistent, and update some of the copy here and there.  Overall, it's me and my work!

## Day 31: September 9, Friday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned that responsive tables are HARD.

**Thoughts** 
I am so frustrated!  This has been probably my least productive day of the challenge.  It is SO hard to make tables responsive.  It was easy enough to make everything display: block, but then the thead is missing from each column of course.  Ugh!  Going to go to the discord community for this one.  I even tried using an NPM package that totally almost worked, but then the breakpoint was wrong and I'm not sure how to fix that.  Feeling a little defeated today!

## Day 32 & 33: September 10, Saturday & September 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned about sorting!!

**Thoughts** 
It took me a minute (2 dayssss) to understand sorting my array of objects, but I got it now!  I feel like I have lots of little pieces of knowledge, and sometimes I have a hard time putting them together right.  Once I get stuff put together though it feels AWESOME!  I think I need to focus less on tutorials and more on just building projects so I'm actually seeing how to use things IRL.  I started with sorting the content on the component level, and after I got that I figured out how to sort my data query instead!  I also learned how to order the content in Sanity which is SO COOL.  Feeling good today  :)

## Day 34: September 12, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Learned how to make a typewriter effect with both javascript and css (preferred the js solution)

**Thoughts** 
This was both fun AND frustrating!  I would still like to add a little cursor animation, and a pause after the 'hi'.  Tomorrow!

 ---

## Day 35: September 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**
Added my resume to the portfolio site.  Also updated links on the Dirty Carrots site, and started building a topnav for the blog layout.

**Thoughts** 
I wish there was was more time everyday.  There's never enough time to do all the things I'd like to do!  I am SUPER excited to be wrapping up my portfolio page!  I am itching to get back to building out Dirty Carrots and the Plantones site.  I have a new project idea in mind that I am REALLY excited about, but I am not going to start it until I finish what I have going!  Or at least get to an MVP.  Need more time!!

## Day 36: September 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**
Updated resume on website, added a cute little cursor animation!

**Thoughts** 
I am ready to start applying for jobs!!  Ready enough anyways... There's always something to work on!

## Day 37: September 16, Friday

**Today's Progress & THoughts:**
Worked on the dev blog a bit.  Added a link and some styles to the nav component, and worked on blog posts styles.  I wasn't happy with the blog post styles though, so I will probably scrap and start over :)

## Day 38: September 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on dirty carrots mobile styles.

Thoughts:
Looking better! I've decided I do NOT like the kitchen sink approach for rich text.  I'm going to style the text in the blog posts I have, and will add on as needed!

## Day 39: September 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Worked on dirty carrots styles and began adding work in progress ribbon to project sites.

Thoughts:
Something weird is going on with my ribbon styles!  It's not using the right font for some reason.

--- 

## Day 40: September 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**
Finished the Work in Progress ribbon on Dirty Carrots! 

Thoughts:
 There's still something weird going on... I think probably I did something weird when setting up my page layouts maybe?  I was having a really hard time getting it to recognize the styles when added to the component on the post layout, and finally got it by using this form: '&[class='rightSide']' (Thanks Scott!)  I'll add it to my other projects and then will be back to building and learning!
